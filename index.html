No more sending files back and forth or dealing with version control nightmares.</p>

    <h3>2. Cloud-Based Storage</h3>
    <p>With CapCut Pro, all your projects are stored in the cloud. This means you and your team can access the project from anywhere, at any time. Whether you’re at home, in a coffee shop, or on a tropical island (lucky you!), your work is just a login away.</p>
